            <h1> The Scoop </h1>
            <p>I'm a junior at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia.
            Im currently pursuing a B.S. in Information Technology with a concentration in Cloud Computing.
            I created this website to showcas e my journey to becoming a cloud engineer.
            The website is a work in progress and is coded with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. This is the first website I've created with CSS 
            and JavaScript, which was certainly a learning curve. I found it particulary tricky to get the mobile version 
            working correctly. I find myself fond of Web Development even though 
            I don't consider it my main interest. The deployment and management of this website is done through AWS. 
            I utilize the free tier on AWS to pay a very low amount for this website. The most expensive cost was buying the domain!
            I use an S3 bucket to serve the static web files. I then use Cloudfront to utilize edge locations and Certificate Manager for an SSL certificate. Finally, 
            I use Route 53 to point towards my custom DNS domain. That's all it takes to host the website. I also have a budget setup and custom billing alerts
            in case my site miraciously garners too much traffic. Oh no! I'm currently working on a JavaScript website traffic counter that stores the count in a DynamoDB.
